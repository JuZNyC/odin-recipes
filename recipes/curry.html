    <p>During the Meiji era (1868 to1912), curry was brought to Japan by 
        British naval officers, who adapted Indian curry to satisfy their own 
        palates and shared that version with the Japanese. Since then, 
        the dish evolved into a national staple that commonly features chunks 
        of protein and potatoes, carrots, and onions coated in a sweet 
        and savory brown sauce. It’s eaten with rice in households, restaurants, 
        and other venues across Japan and is often served with 
        fukujinzuke (sweet and salty pickles) or tonkatsu (deep-fried pork cutlet).

    <p>A plate of kare raisu or Japanese curry rice has the power 
        to nourish the body and soul on even the coldest of days. 
        While you can make Japanese curry—beloved for its mildly spicy, 
        umami-rich flavor—from scratch, it’s an easy dish to throw together with just three 
        ingredients. All you need is a box of curry roux cubes and your choice of protein and 
        vegetable. Whenever I make Japanese curry, I’m always surprised at how quickly the dish 
        comes together. The curry roux cubes melt into a pan of sautéed chicken, potatoes, 
        and a couple cups of water in just a few minutes, resulting in a velvety sauce 
        perfect for spooning over rice. Read on to find out how to make it for yourself.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 pound chicken breasts or thighs, cut into 1-inch cubes (or another protein of your choice)</li>
        <li>2 medium potatoes, peeled and cubed </li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups water</li>
        <li>1 3.2-ounce package of curry cubes (such as S&B’s Golden Curry)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat and sauté the protein for about 5 minutes. Add potatoes and/or other vegetables, if using, and sauté for another 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the water and bring everything to a boil. Then lower the heat and simmer, covered, for about 15 minutes. </li>
        <li>Turn the heat to low. Break the curry roux into cubes and add them to the mixture. Stir until the cubes are completely melted. Simmer for another 5 minutes or until the curry is heated through. Serve with rice.</li>
